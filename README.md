FDF is a 42 Project to learn about 3d programming. The program takes a map as parameter and creates its 3d representation.

Render a 3D map from a 2D representation. Initially I was using vectors and simple formulas as illustrated by formula.c file. Later I switched to matrixes.
You can rotate, increase altitude coefficient and zoom in/out. All transformations are done through matrixes transformations except for the one translating the picture.
